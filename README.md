The TUNIROBOTS CUP competition, organized as part of Tunisia's national robotics day TUNIROBOTS17, is a fun and technological challenge.
This meeting is for young people passionate about robotics and new technologies.
Participants in the TUNIROBOTS CUP come with the goal of sharing their knowledge and skills in science, party around a smoking engine and admire the tips and invented systems.

## Goal of the game

For this edition, two tribes clash with the ultimate goal of capturing the limited resources of the forest region.
With the imminent robotic revolution and the progressively devastating evolution of the field of artificial intelligence, the fight promises to be as fierce as it is meticulously calculated.

## Missions

#### BIRD HUNTING

The autonomous robot has to climb the hill to hunt the bird.

#### THE OPENING OF THE TREE PORTAL

The autonomous robot can open the gate by pushing the saw, while the remote robot can open it by clicking on the button located to the left of the gate.

#### COLLECTING AMMUNITION / ATTACK

Once inside the battle zone, the robots collect the battle stones associated with their colors in order to attack their opponent or territory by hitting them with the stones and to defend the resources.

#### COLLECTION OF TREASURE

By attacking the guardian of the cave, the robot has the opportunity to acquire the treasure (5 more hunting stones).
The attack is done by throwing a stone into the cave.
